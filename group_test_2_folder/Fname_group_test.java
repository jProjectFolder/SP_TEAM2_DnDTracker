PURPOSE:        1. Java file for team members to create their own copy of and upload to the GitHub for practicing adding a java class (a file) to a project folder.
                2. Also for deciding some standardization for team members when coding their files. This gives example of what header we would want on each file and what headers we would want for methods inside the class.
CONNECTIONS:    List other classes or files that this .java file reads from or writes to.
READS:          The .java file name and what this file reads from that file.
WRITES          The .java file name and what this file writes to that file.
LIST OF METHODS:List all the methods contatined in this class, their input parameters, and their outputs
